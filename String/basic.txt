after using any method on string it will always return a new string

what is string interpolation?
ans: we can insert variable directly in template literals. this is called string interpolation


Can i change the string ?
ans : Although String has the similarity with array, we can't change the strings element like the array.
     E.G. const num = [1,23,432];
            num[2]= 3;
            //output num =[1,23,3]

            const name = 'sadee'
            name[2]='s'
            //output name = 'sadee'

            // BUT WE CAN FOLLOW HE PROCESS BELOW TO CHANGE THE LETTER OF String
            let newName = name.replace(name[3],"f")
